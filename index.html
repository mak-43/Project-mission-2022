                <p>The best way to prevent the coronavirus is to not get it in the first place. There are vaccines for COVID-19 and they are free to the public, so you should consider getting one.
                The virus spreads mostly through droplets that people send out when they talk, sneeze, or cough. These usually donâ€™t stay in the air for long or go farther than 6 feet. But the coronavirus might also travel through tiny aerosol particles that can linger for up to 3 hours and travel farther away. This is why wearing a facial covering can be important. It can keep you from giving it to others as well as helping you avoid breathing it in
